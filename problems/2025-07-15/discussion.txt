If we imagine a 2x10 grid, where we label each tile 1-20 from top left to bottom right, every valid pair can be represented as a 1x2 or 2x1 tile (notice that {10, 11} cannot be a pair). Each tiling of the grid represents a validd solution. If we let f(n) be the number of valid tilings of a 2xn grid, we can see that we want f(10). Notice that on the side we can either put a vertical tile, or 2 horizontal tiles, which leaves us with a 2xn-1 and a 2xn-2 grid respectively. Since there are no other possibilities, we get that we can solve the n-1 case or the n-2 case, or f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2), which is a fibonacci sequence. Adjustint for starting conditions, we get that f(10) is 89.
