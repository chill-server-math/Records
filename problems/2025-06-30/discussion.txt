Let the innermost rectangle have length x. Its area is x × 1 = x. The next rectangle has dimensions (x + 2) by 3, giving an area of 3x + 6. The shaded region between the first two rectangles is therefore (3x + 6) − x = 2x + 6. The largest rectangle has dimensions (x + 4) by 5, with area 5x + 20. The shaded region between the largest rectangle and the middle one is (5x + 20) − (3x + 6) = 2x + 14. According to the problem, the shaded areas x, 2x + 6, and 2x + 14 form an arithmetic sequence, which means consecutive differences are equal. Thus (2x + 6) − x = (2x + 14) − (2x + 6), so x + 6 = 8, giving x = 2. The answer is B.
