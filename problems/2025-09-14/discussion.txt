In this problem, both Mario and the Monster start at the far corners Top Right, Bottom Left respectively. Mario can only move down or left, and likewise, the monster can only move up or right. We can observe that the two can only meet on the 4th move, along the diagonal. Thus, we can count the total number of ways for each to reach the same point on the diagonal. Each proability can be represented as choosing an amount of horizontal moves out of the 4 moves. Notice that only the number of horizontal moves affects the final position, and not the order. The probability that Mario ends up on the far left corner corrosponds to the probability he does 4 choose 4 horizontal moves, equaling 1. Similarly, the next point on the diagonal is represented by 3 choose 4, equaling 4 moves. Going along, we see the possiblities for each point are 1,4,6,4, and 1, adding up to 16 possible positions Mario could be. Likewise, the monster also has the same prossiblities. For each point, the probability that Mario dies there is the probability that both make it to the point. In the case of the far left, it would be (1/16) * (1/16), or just (1/16)^2. THe rest follow similarly, and adding them up gets a total of 70/256. Note that this is the probability Mario dies, so we must subtract it from 1 to get the probability he survives to be 186/256, or 72.6%.
