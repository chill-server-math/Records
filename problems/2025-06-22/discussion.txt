For the product to be odd, each of the three numbers must be odd. The probability of this happening is (1008/2016) × (1007/2015) × (1006/2014). The first fraction simplifies to 1/2, while the other two are both just under 1/2. Therefore, the entire product is a little less than (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/8. So the answer is (A) p < 1/8.
